# Market Aide

1. The main idea of this website is to help users discover the cheapest place to buy the item they want. Instead of searching on google for an item and having to click on individual websites to investigate the price and quality, Market Aide uses AI and a pricing API to find the cheapest option for you, complete with the product link, description and photo.
2. This website can also be used to help you sell your item by analyzing the price of your item on other websites. Market Aide will also automatically generate a product description for you to post when you do end up selling your item.

3. I spent around 3 hours on this project.
